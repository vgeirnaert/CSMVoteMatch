CSMVoteMatch
============

A Vote Match website for the Eve Online Council of Stellar Management elections.

#How matching is done

The matching is done based on a questionnaire of a number of statements about Eve Online. We have collected the answers from the candidates in the CSM election. After you fill in the questionnaire on this page, your answers will be compared to the answers of the candidates.

Based on how each of your answers matches up with each of the answers of each of the candidates, we calculate a score from zero (no match) to a hundred percent (perfect match) for each candidate. You will then be presented with an overview of all the candidates and their answers, ranked from highest match to lowest match.

We use a matching algoritm similar to the one used on the dating website OKCupid - though we use the values 0 (irrelevant), 1 (a little important), 5 (somewhat important), 10 (very important) and 50 (mandatory) instead of OKCupid's 0, 1, 10, 50, 250.
